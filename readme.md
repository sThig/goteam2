## GO TEAM ⚽
This is a Js/UI/UX project where I'm going to have it to enter in several names and it creates a team with a captain and co-captain (chosen at random)

## List
* user enters names in the form (comma separated)
* array is formed
* spread operator takes array and randomly assigns a captain and co-captain while the rest are team players
* Captain gets a shiny ⭐ ⭐ for being captain
* Co Captain gets only one ⭐
* team gets listed in a <ul>

# Notes
* having a hard time with the forEach loop when I know is basic stuff, it's just that this is hard for me right now (being completely transparent).
* learning about the rest operator, that's fun, I like that
